    "    * Type `tcsh` to switch to that shell, then set `x=3`, then `echo $x`\n",
    "    * To confirm which shell you're in, use `echo $0`\n",
    "    * Switching to tcsh shell means we're technically in a subshell: each new terminal is an environment, so we can type exit to leave the subshell\n",
    "    \n",
    "### FSL Setup and Paths \n",
    "* Code in .bashrc (bash run commands) file is run anytime you create a new shell in bash and updates something called the path variable\n",
